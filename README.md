A significant issue in the research fields of pattern recognition and computer vision is the classification of handwritten digits using the K-fold algorithm. This article gives a thorough investigation into the use of ANN for precisely categorizing numbers written on paper.

The approach that has been suggested entails using a dataset of labeled handwritten digits, such as that provided by MNIST, to train an ANN model. The output is the digit label, and the input consists of pixel values that represent grayscale images of handwritten digits.

The efficacy of the ANN model is determined by an array of trials. The efficiency of the classification is evaluated using the accuracy metric. To ascertain their impact on the model's accuracy, various factors are examined, including the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the choice of the activation function.

Results show that the suggested ANN-based approach effectively divides handwritten digits with high accuracy. The model can perform at the cutting edge on benchmark datasets by properly altering the hyperparameters and network design. The results show how well K-folds handles complex and nonlinear patterns, making it a valuable tool for tasks requiring the categorization of digits written by hand.
